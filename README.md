# Adaptive Foraging and Exinction Cascades

Simulations and analyses examining the role of adaptive foraging in determining
the probabilty and size of extinction cascades in foodwebs.

# Directory Structure / Organization

`src/` :
    Implementation of things needed performing the simulations and analyses. Not
    upstreamed because they're specific to this research project.

`scripts/` :
    Scripts which perform simulations or analyses/plotting. Each file is self
    containned. 

`scripts/simulation-scripts` :

    Scripts in the `simulation-scripts` subdirectory are potentially very long
    running and are intended to be run as batch jobs on a HPC cluster.

`scripts/simulation-scripts` :

    Scripts in the `analysis-scripts` subdirectory are used to analyze/plot the
    results of simulations.

`sim-output/` :
    Top-level directory for storing data output from simulations. Each run
    produces a directory named as `stem-Y-M-D-[a-z]` where the stem is a string
    set in the simulation script. 

`figures/` :
    Output directory for figures generated by scripts in
    `scripts/analysis-scripts`.
